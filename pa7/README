	BigInteger.h
		Includes the definitions of structures and prototypes for a BigInteger ADT
	
	BigInteger.c
		Implementation of BigInteger ADT

	BigIntegerTest.c
		Tests the BigInteger ADT functions including:

			-Creation of default BigInteger fields are correct
			- 7 Sign cases for Add
			- 7 Sign cases for Sum
			- 7 Sign cases for Diff
			- 7 Sign cases for Subtract
			- Sign cases for Multiply
			- Sign cases for Product
			- Equals works appropriately
			- Carries work for Add / Sum and Subtract / Diff
			- Negate takes the inverse sign of BigInt
			- MakeZero empties the BigInt

	List.h
		public file including the definitions of structures and the prototypes
	
	List.c
		implementation of list.h AKA the linked list ADT

	ListTest.c
		Tests the List.c ADT functions including:

			-Creation of default lists fields are correct
			-append and prepend on a default / filled list inserts nodes correctly relative to current cursor index
			-InsertBefore and insertAfter on a default / filled list inserts nodes correctly relative to current cursor index
			-MoveNext and MovePrev changes index position
				-will not move out of bounds instead just returns -1
			-MoveFront / MoveBack move index to respective nodes in List (accounts for empty list
			-Index returns the current Node pointed to
			-delete sets cursor index to 0
			-deleteFront and deleteBack removes the front and back elements if index is valid
			-Clear sets list to default
			-Set will replace data element of index node if valid
			-Checks concat properly joins lists and set position to 0 and fields appropriately
			-listEQ checks if two lists are equal to each other

				*NOTE: note prints to console shell. no input / output file needed

	Arithmetic.c
		IO operations
			Reads 4 lines of an input file
			Creates 2 BigIntegers with string input on line 2 and 3

			Prints the BigInteger & Does Calculations on BigIntegers:
			 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐴+𝐵, 𝐴 −𝐵, 𝐴 −𝐴, 3𝐴−2𝐵, 𝐴𝐵, 𝐴2, 𝐵2, 9𝐴4+16𝐵5
			
			Example:
				$./Arithmetic in.txt out.txt

	Makefile
		make Arithmetic 	 	makes Arithmetic executable
		make ListTest.c 		makes ListTest executable
		make BigIntegerTest.c 	makes BigIntegerTest executable
		make clean 				removes all binaries
		make memcheck 			checks memory leaks in valgrind *Theres a lot! -n-

	Usage:
		$./Arithmetic <in.txt> <out.txt>
